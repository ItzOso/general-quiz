## 📝 Notes

This project helped me improve my understanding of API integration, `localStorage` usage, and dynamic DOM manipulation. I also learned to handle game state, asynchronous operations, and transitions between pages in a single-page flow. This was a fun and interactive way to solidify JavaScript fundamentals.
